Create:
- app.py
- create script and everything to make app.py work
- create : pyproject.toml 
	by using this command: 
		'ni pyproject.toml' or use poetry
- add content to the .toml file
- to list modules/packages run the ff:
	'pip freeze > requirements.txt'
- get list from requirements.txt' then make its list into acceptable format using this command in PowerShell:
    - # Read requirements.txt and format for pyproject.toml
    - Get-Content requirements.txt | ForEach-Object { "    `"$_`"," }
    - content above copy to dependencies in .toml
    
- how to use poetry:
	- pip install poetry
	- poetry init (creates .toml file . you can delete .toml and create it using this command)

- currently we are using poetry:
	here are the poetry commands:
	poetry install
	# Add a new package (automatically updates pyproject.toml)
	poetry add new-package-name

	# Run your Python scripts
	poetry run python your_script.py

- comment out the last [build-system] if you want to use pip instead of poetry when installing python packages
